# Overview

This project is about DFT and Machine Learning, and it is part of my Postdoc research at Vanderbilt University.
The title of the contribution is:  
#### "DFT and Machine Learning for predicting Hydrogen Adsorption Energies on rocksalt complex oxides."

The prediction of hydrogen adsorption energies on complex oxides by integrating DFT calculations and Machine Learning is considered. 
In particular, 14 descriptors for electronic and geometric properties evaluation are adapted within a 336 hydrogen adsorption energy 
dataset created. Supervised learning techniques were explored to establish an accurate predictive model. With the Deep Neural Network 
results, a MAE of about 0.06 eV is achieved. This research highlights the synergistic potential of DFT and Machine Learning for accelerating 
the exploration of materials for catalysis, with a significance to assisting in the understanding of structure-reactivity relationship of high-entropy oxides.

# Dataset
